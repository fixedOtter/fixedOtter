## Hello cousin!

I am fixedOtter, but most just call me gungun. 

- I'm currently learning to be a full stack web developer through the University of Minnesota
- I love talking about spirituality and the afterlife! Have you ever heard of a past life regression meditation? ;)
- Feel free to contact me at my work email [here!](mailto:fo1152rc@gominnstate.edu)
- I usually go by he / him pronouns, but feel free to use whatever fits in the moment :)
- Fun fact: Computers kinda suck in space, and it's quite special that we have computers that work they way we use them here on earth! (We really have our atmosphere to thank for protecting our computers, so let's try to protect our atmosphere!) You can learn more about space radiation [here! :)](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/postsecondary/features/F_Understanding_Space_Radiation.html)
