## Hello cousin!

I am fixedOtter, but most just call[^1] me gungun. 

- I'm currently learning to be a full stack web developer at the University of Minnesota
- I love talking about spirituality and the afterlife! Have you ever heard of a past life regression meditation? ðŸ˜‰
- Feel free to contact me at my school email [here!](mailto:fo1152rc@gominnstate.edu)
- I usually go by he / him pronouns, but feel free to use whatever fits in the moment ðŸ˜Š
- Fun fact: Computers kinda suck in space, and it's quite special that we have computers that work they way we use them here on earth! (We really have our atmosphere to thank for protecting our computers, so let's try to protect our atmosphere! ðŸ˜‰) You can learn more about space radiation [here! :)](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/postsecondary/features/F_Understanding_Space_Radiation.html)
