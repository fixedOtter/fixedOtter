## Hello cousin!

I am fixedOtter, but most just call[^1] me gungun. 

- I'm currently completing my undergrad in Physics and Astrophysics at NAU.
- I love talking about spirituality and the afterlife! Have you ever heard of a past life regression meditation? ðŸ˜‰
- Feel free to contact me at my school email [here!](mailto:gj392@nau.edu)
- I usually go by he / him pronouns, but you can call me whatever as long as you aren't cursing me out! ðŸ˜Š
- Fun fact: Computers kinda suck in space, and it's quite special that we have computers that work they way we use them here on earth! (We really have our atmosphere to thank for protecting our computers, so let's try to protect our atmosphere! ðŸ˜‰) You can learn more about space radiation [here! :)](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/postsecondary/features/F_Understanding_Space_Radiation.html)
